# theorydb Supply-Chain Allowlist (SEC-3)
#
# Purpose: reduce false positives from heuristic supply-chain scanning without weakening the gate.
# This file is a plain-text allowlist of exact finding IDs emitted by `SEC-3` (go mod verify).
#
# Rules:
# - One ID per line.
# - `#` comments are allowed.
# - Keep this file versioned in git; treat allowlist changes as security-relevant.
# - Prefer fixing/removing the dependency over allowlisting. If you allowlist, include a justification comment.
#
# Example (copy from `hgm-infra/evidence/SEC-3-output.log`):
# HGM-SUPPLY:GO:REPLACE:rule=REMOTE_REPLACE:from=github.com/example/upstream@v1.2.3:to=github.com/example/fork@v1.2.3
